## Adaptive Music System | UE5 + FMOD

This repository contains selected C++ code samples from an adaptive music system implemented in Unreal Engine 5 using FMOD.

The system is based on level-driven music zones communicating with a central music system actor.
Music playback is managed through buffered transitions, gate-based timing, and FMOD timeline markers to ensure smooth musical continuity.

The samples focus on architectural decisions and production-ready solutions rather than full engine boilerplate.
